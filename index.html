                    Hello! I'm Mohd Alman from India, with over 4 years of experience in the crypto space. I have had the privilege of moderating for notable projects like Clip Protocol, Zt Exchange, MEXC, Bitget (formerly Bitkeep), and Coinhub. My time as a Bitkeep Knight at Bitget was a particularly enriching experience, allowing me to dive deep into the world of crypto moderation and community management.
                    <br>
                    Beyond moderation, I have a solid track record in shilling for various projects, including Bit Rivals, GnusAI, Kaarigar Connect, and Me3. My ability to effectively communicate project value has helped me connect with diverse audiences and build engaged communities. Additionally, I've managed social media handles for various crypto communities, where I honed my skills in content creation, audience engagement, and strategic planning.
                    <br>
                    I am passionate about leveraging my experience to foster vibrant and supportive communities. My adaptability, strong communication skills, and deep understanding of the crypto ecosystem make me a valuable asset to any project I am part of. I look forward to continuing my journey in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.
